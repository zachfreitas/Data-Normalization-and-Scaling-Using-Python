    "# Overview\n",
    "Data analysis is the process of systematically examining and interpreting data to conclude, identify patterns, and make decisions. Data analysts work with large and complex datasets and use a variety of tools and techniques to clean, transform, and aggregate the data. They also use statistical methods to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the data, and to make predictions about future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is a critical part of data wrangling because it allows us to make sense of large and complex datasets, and to use that information to drive better decision-making. During the data wrangling process, we typically encounter data that requires cleaning, transformation, and aggregation to be analyzed. Once the data has been prepared, data analysis helps us to identify trends, correlations, and relationships within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, data analysis helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of different data-wrangling techniques and make necessary adjustments to ensure data accuracy and completeness. This ensures that the results we get from data analysis are reliable and trustworthy, allowing us to make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will cover the topic of hypothesis tests which is one of the ways we can analyze data. Hypothesis tests help us to determine whether a particular assumption or claim about a population is valid or not based on a sample of data. This is useful for making informed decisions, such as determining whether a new product is more effective than an existing one, or whether a particular marketing campaign is successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this module, the learners will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discuss the importance of data analysis in making informed decisions\n",
    "* Apply various hypothesis tests to analyze and interpret data\n",
    "* Evaluate the results of hypothesis tests to draw conclusions about the data\n",
    "* Analyze the relationships between variables using correlation analysis\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset\n",
    "Titanic dataset: This is a well-known and widely used dataset in the field of data analysis and machine learning. This dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic ship, including their demographic information, ticket information, and survival status. In this exercise, we're using the Titanic dataset to perform various hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a description of the columns in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PassengerId: This column is a unique identifier assigned to each passenger.\n",
    "* Age: This column specifies the age of the passenger.\n",
    "* Name: This column specifies the name of the passenger.\n",
    "* Sex: This column specifies the gender of the passenger (Male or Female).\n",
    "* Survived: This column specifies whether the passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. The values in this column can either be 0 (did not survive) or 1 (survived).\n",
    "* Pclass (Passenger Class): This column specifies the class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).\n",
    "* SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard): This column specifies the number of siblings or spouses the passenger was traveling with.\n",
    "* Parch (Parents/Children Aboard): This column specifies the number of parents or children the passenger was traveling with.\n",
    "* Ticket: This column specifies the ticket number assigned to the passenger.\n",
    "* Fare: This column specifies the fare paid by the passenger for their ticket.\n",
    "* Cabin: This column specifies the cabin number assigned to the passenger.\n",
    "* Embarked: This column specifies the port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What are hypothesis tests?\n",
    "Performing hypothesis tests is an essential aspect of data analysis because it allows us to make informed decisions based on the available evidence. Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support or reject a particular claim or hypothesis about a population parameter based on a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of performing a hypothesis test involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the null and alternative hypotheses:** The null hypothesis (H0) is the default assumption or status quo that there is no significant difference between a sample statistic and a population parameter, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is the claim or hypothesis that we are testing.\n",
    "2. **Choose the appropriate test statistic:** The choice of the test statistic depends on the type of data and the hypothesis being tested.\n",
    "3. **Determine the significance level:** The significance level (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Typically, a significance level of 0.05 is used.\n",
    "4. **Calculate the p-value:** The p-value is the probability of obtaining a sample statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "5. **Compare the p-value with the significance level:** If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are they important?\n",
    "Performing hypothesis tests is important in data analysis because it allows us to make data-driven decisions based on statistical evidence rather than relying on intuition or personal beliefs. Hypothesis testing can be used to test a wide range of claims or hypotheses, such as whether a new product is more effective than an existing one, whether there is a significant difference between two groups, or whether a particular intervention has an impact on a certain outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, hypothesis testing can help to identify potential errors or biases in the data, such as sampling bias or measurement error. It can also be used to assess the reliability and validity of statistical models and to test assumptions underlying statistical analyses. Therefore, performing hypothesis tests is an essential tool for making valid and reliable inferences from data.\n",
