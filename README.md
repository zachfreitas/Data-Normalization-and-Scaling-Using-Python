# Data-Normalization-and-Scaling-Using-Python
Data normalization and scaling are techniques used to adjust the values of a dataset so that they are on a similar scale and have the same properties. This is important because many statistical and machine learning algorithms assume that the data is normally distributed, or that the features are on a similar scale.
